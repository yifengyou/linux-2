- we should probably extend pthread_mutexattr_t with a field to create a
  single linked list of all instances.  This requires changing the
  pthread_mutexattr_* functions.


- a new attribute for mutexes: number of times we spin before calling
sys_futex



- test with threaded process terminating and semadj (?) being applied
  only after all threads are gone
