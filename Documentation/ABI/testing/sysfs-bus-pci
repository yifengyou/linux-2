Description:
		A file named vpd in a device directory will be a
		binary file containing the Vital Product Data for the
		device.  It should follow the VPD format defined in
		PCI Specification 2.1 or 2.2, but users should consider
		that some devices may have malformatted data.  If the
		underlying VPD has a writable section then the
		corresponding section of this file will be writable.
