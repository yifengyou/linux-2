	  DMA engines can do asynchronous data transfers without
	  involving the host CPU.  Currently, this framework can be
	  used to offload memory copies in the network stack and
	  RAID operations in the MD driver.

config INTEL_IOATDMA
	tristate "Intel I/OAT DMA support"
	depends on PCI && X86
	select DMA_ENGINE
	select DCA
	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) I/OAT DMA engine present
	  in recent Intel Xeon chipsets.

	  Say Y here if you have such a chipset.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_IOP_ADMA
	tristate "Intel IOP ADMA support"
	depends on ARCH_IOP32X || ARCH_IOP33X || ARCH_IOP13XX
	select ASYNC_CORE
	select DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) IOP Series RAID engines.

config FSL_DMA
	bool "Freescale MPC85xx/MPC83xx DMA support"
	depends on PPC
	select DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Freescale DMA engine. Now, it support
	  MPC8560/40, MPC8555, MPC8548 and MPC8641 processors.
	  The MPC8349, MPC8360 is also supported.

config DMA_ENGINE
	bool

config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && NET
	help
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	  Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	  say Y here.
