          Ethernet controllers.

	  Additional receive skb headroom. Note, that driver
	  will always reserve at least 2 bytes to make IP header
	  aligned, so usually there is no need to add any additional
	  headroom.

	  If unsure, set to 0.

	  Enable this if EMAC attached to a PHY which doesn't generate
	  RX clock if there is no link, if this is the case, you will
	  see "TX disable timeout" or "RX disable timeout" in the system
	  log.

	  If unsure, say N.
