/**
 * BSM (Bootstrap State Machine)
 *
 * The Bootstrap State Machine (BSM) stores a short bootstrap uCode program
 * in special SRAM that does not power down when the embedded control
 * processor is sleeping (e.g. for periodic power-saving shutdowns of radio).
 *
 * When powering back up after sleeps (or during initial uCode load), the BSM
 * internally loads the short bootstrap program from the special SRAM into the
 * embedded processor's instruction SRAM, and starts the processor so it runs
 * the bootstrap program.
 *
 * This bootstrap program loads (via PCI busmaster DMA) instructions and data
 * images for a uCode program from host DRAM locations.  The host driver
 * indicates DRAM locations and sizes for instruction and data images via the
 * four BSM_DRAM_* registers.  Once the bootstrap program loads the new program,
 * the new program starts automatically.
 *
 * The uCode used for open-source drivers includes two programs:
 *
 * 1)  Initialization -- performs hardware calibration and sets up some
 *     internal data, then notifies host via "initialize alive" notification
 *     (struct iwl_init_alive_resp) that it has completed all of its work.
 *     After signal from host, it then loads and starts the runtime program.
 *     The initialization program must be used when initially setting up the
 *     NIC after loading the driver.
 *
 * 2)  Runtime/Protocol -- performs all normal runtime operations.  This
 *     notifies host via "alive" notification (struct iwl_alive_resp) that it
 *     is ready to be used.
 *
 * When initializing the NIC, the host driver does the following procedure:
 *
 * 1)  Load bootstrap program (instructions only, no data image for bootstrap)
 *     into bootstrap memory.  Use dword writes starting at BSM_SRAM_LOWER_BOUND
 *
 * 2)  Point (via BSM_DRAM_*) to the "initialize" uCode data and instruction
 *     images in host DRAM.
 *
 * 3)  Set up BSM to copy from BSM SRAM into uCode instruction SRAM when asked:
 *     BSM_WR_MEM_SRC_REG = 0
 *     BSM_WR_MEM_DST_REG = RTC_INST_LOWER_BOUND
 *     BSM_WR_MEM_DWCOUNT_REG = # dwords in bootstrap instruction image
 *
 * 4)  Load bootstrap into instruction SRAM:
 *     BSM_WR_CTRL_REG = BSM_WR_CTRL_REG_BIT_START
 *
 * 5)  Wait for load completion:
 *     Poll BSM_WR_CTRL_REG for BSM_WR_CTRL_REG_BIT_START = 0
 *
 * 6)  Enable future boot loads whenever NIC's power management triggers it:
 *     BSM_WR_CTRL_REG = BSM_WR_CTRL_REG_BIT_START_EN
 *
 * 7)  Start the NIC by removing all reset bits:
 *     CSR_RESET = 0
 *
 *     The bootstrap uCode (already in instruction SRAM) loads initialization
 *     uCode.  Initialization uCode performs data initialization, sends
 *     "initialize alive" notification to host, and waits for a signal from
 *     host to load runtime code.
 *
 * 4)  Point (via BSM_DRAM_*) to the "runtime" uCode data and instruction
 *     images in host DRAM.  The last register loaded must be the instruction
 *     bytecount register ("1" in MSbit tells initialization uCode to load
 *     the runtime uCode):
 *     BSM_DRAM_INST_BYTECOUNT_REG = bytecount | BSM_DRAM_INST_LOAD
 *
 * 5)  Wait for "alive" notification, then issue normal runtime commands.
 *
 * Data caching during power-downs:
 *
 * Just before the embedded controller powers down (e.g for automatic
 * power-saving modes, or for RFKILL), uCode stores (via PCI busmaster DMA)
 * a current snapshot of the embedded processor's data SRAM into host DRAM.
 * This caches the data while the embedded processor's memory is powered down.
 * Location and size are controlled by BSM_DRAM_DATA_* registers.
 *
 * NOTE:  Instruction SRAM does not need to be saved, since that doesn't
 *        change during operation; the original image (from uCode distribution
 *        file) can be used for reload.
 *
 * When powering back up, the BSM loads the bootstrap program.  Bootstrap looks
 * at the BSM_DRAM_* registers, which now point to the runtime instruction
 * image and the cached (modified) runtime data (*not* the initialization
 * uCode).  Bootstrap reloads these runtime images into SRAM, and restarts the
 * uCode from where it left off before the power-down.
 *
 * NOTE:  Initialization uCode does *not* run as part of the save/restore
 *        procedure.
 *
 * This save/restore method is mostly for autonomous power management during
 * normal operation (result of POWER_TABLE_CMD).  Platform suspend/resume and
 * RFKILL should use complete restarts (with total re-initialization) of uCode,
 * allowing total shutdown (including BSM memory).
 *
 * Note that, during normal operation, the host DRAM that held the initial
 * startup data for the runtime code is now being used as a backup data cache
 * for modified data!  If you need to completely re-initialize the NIC, make
 * sure that you use the runtime data image from the uCode distribution file,
 * not the modified/saved runtime data.  You may want to store a separate
 * "clean" runtime data image in DRAM to avoid disk reads of distribution file.
