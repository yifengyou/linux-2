config XEN_BALLOON
	bool "Xen memory balloon driver"
	depends on XEN
	default y
	help
	  The balloon driver allows the Xen domain to request more memory from
	  the system to expand the domain's memory allocation, or alternatively
	  return unneeded memory to the system.

config XEN_SCRUB_PAGES
	bool "Scrub pages before returning them to system"
	depends on XEN_BALLOON
	default y
	help
	  Scrub pages before returning them to the system for reuse by
	  other domains.  This makes sure that any confidential data
	  is not accidentally visible to other domains.  Is it more
	  secure, but slightly less efficient.
	  If in doubt, say yes.
