	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.  And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is

	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below.

	  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel
	  (MCA) or VESA.  ISA is an older system, now being displaced by PCI;
	  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

config EISA
	bool
	---help---
	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
	  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

	  Otherwise, say N.

config MCA
	bool
	help
	  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
	  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
	  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
	  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

       help
         The Maple Bus is SEGA's serial communication bus for peripherals
         on the Dreamcast. Without this bus support you won't be able to
         get your Dreamcast keyboard etc to work, so most users
         probably want to say 'Y' here, unless you are only using the
         Dreamcast with a serial line terminal or a remote network
         connection.

config CF_ENABLER

	---help---
	  Compact Flash is a small, removable mass storage device introduced
	  in 1994 originally as a PCMCIA device.  If you say `Y' here, you
	  compile in support for Compact Flash devices directly connected to
	  a SuperH processor.  A Compact Flash FAQ is available at
	  <http://www.compactflash.org/faqs/faq.htm>.

	  If your board has "Directly Connected" CompactFlash at area 5 or 6,
	  you may want to enable this option.  Then, you can use CF as
	  primary IDE drive (only tested for SanDisk).

	  If in doubt, select 'N'.

config CF_AREA5
	bool "Area5"
	help
	  If your board has "Directly Connected" CompactFlash, You should
	  select the area where your CF is connected to.

	  - "Area5" if CompactFlash is connected to Area 5 (0x14000000)
	  - "Area6" if it is connected to Area 6 (0x18000000)

	  "Area6" will work for most boards.
