/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * mac80211 is the Linux stack for 802.11 hardware that implements
 * only partial functionality in hard- or firmware. This document
 * defines the interface between mac80211 and low-level hardware
 * drivers.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Calling mac80211 from interrupts
 *
 * Only ieee80211_tx_status_irqsafe() and ieee80211_rx_irqsafe() can be
 * called in hardware interrupt context. The low-level driver must not call any
 * other functions in hardware interrupt context. If there is a need for such
 * call, the low-level driver should first ACK the interrupt and perform the
 * IEEE 802.11 code call after this, e.g. from a scheduled workqueue or even
 * tasklet function.
 *
 * NOTE: If the driver opts to use the _irqsafe() functions, it may not also
 *	 use the non-irqsafe functions!
 */

/**
 * DOC: Warning
 *
 * If you're reading this document and not the header file itself, it will
 * be incomplete because not all documentation has been converted yet.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Frame format
 *
 * As a general rule, when frames are passed between mac80211 and the driver,
 * they start with the IEEE 802.11 header and include the same octets that are
 * sent over the air except for the FCS which should be calculated by the
 * hardware.
 *
 * There are, however, various exceptions to this rule for advanced features:
 *
 * The first exception is for hardware encryption and decryption offload
 * where the IV/ICV may or may not be generated in hardware.
 *
 * Secondly, when the hardware handles fragmentation, the frame handed to
 * the driver from mac80211 is the MSDU, not the MPDU.
 *
 * Finally, for received frames, the driver is able to indicate that it has
 * filled a radiotap header and put that in front of the frame; if it does
 * not do so then mac80211 may add this under certain circumstances.

 * be used only for transmission.
 * Multiple transmission keys with the same key index may be used when

 *
 * The @local_address parameter will always be set to our own address,
 * this is only relevant if you support multiple local addresses.
 *
 * When transmitting, the TX control data will use the @hw_key_idx

/**
 * DOC: Frame filtering
 *
 * mac80211 requires to see many management frames for proper
 * operation, and users may want to see many more frames when
 * in monitor mode. However, for best CPU usage and power consumption,
 * having as few frames as possible percolate through the stack is
 * desirable. Hence, the hardware should filter as much as possible.
 *
 * To achieve this, mac80211 uses filter flags (see below) to tell
 * the driver's configure_filter() function which frames should be
 * passed to mac80211 and which should be filtered out.
 *
 * The configure_filter() callback is invoked with the parameters
 * @mc_count and @mc_list for the combined multicast address list
 * of all virtual interfaces, @changed_flags telling which flags
 * were changed and @total_flags with the new flag states.
 *
 * If your device has no multicast address filters your driver will
 * need to check both the %FIF_ALLMULTI flag and the @mc_count
 * parameter to see whether multicast frames should be accepted
 * or dropped.
 *
 * All unsupported flags in @total_flags must be cleared.
 * Hardware does not support a flag if it is incapable of _passing_
 * the frame to the stack. Otherwise the driver must ignore
 * the flag, but not clear it.
 * You must _only_ clear the flag (announce no support for the
 * flag to mac80211) if you are not able to pass the packet type
 * to the stack (so the hardware always filters it).
 * So for example, you should clear @FIF_CONTROL, if your hardware
 * always filters control frames. If your hardware always passes
 * control frames to the kernel and is incapable of filtering them,
 * you do _not_ clear the @FIF_CONTROL flag.
 * This rule applies to all other FIF flags as well.

/**
 * struct ieee80211_ops - callbacks from mac80211 to the driver
 *
 * This structure contains various callbacks that the driver may
 * handle or, in some cases, must handle, for example to configure
 * the hardware to a new channel or to transmit a frame.
 *
 * @tx: Handler that 802.11 module calls for each transmitted frame.
 *	skb contains the buffer starting from the IEEE 802.11 header.
 *	The low-level driver should send the frame out based on
 *	configuration in the TX control data. Must be implemented and
 *	atomic.
 *
 * @start: Called before the first netdevice attached to the hardware
 *	is enabled. This should turn on the hardware and must turn on
 *	frame reception (for possibly enabled monitor interfaces.)
 *	Returns negative error codes, these may be seen in userspace,
 *	or zero.
 *	When the device is started it should not have a MAC address
 *	to avoid acknowledging frames before a non-monitor device
 *	is added.
 *	Must be implemented.
 *
 * @stop: Called after last netdevice attached to the hardware
 *	is disabled. This should turn off the hardware (at least
 *	it must turn off frame reception.)
 *	May be called right after add_interface if that rejects
 *	an interface.
 *	Must be implemented.
 *
 * @add_interface: Called when a netdevice attached to the hardware is
 *	enabled. Because it is not called for monitor mode devices, @open
 *	and @stop must be implemented.
 *	The driver should perform any initialization it needs before
 *	the device can be enabled. The initial configuration for the
 *	interface is given in the conf parameter.
 *	The callback may refuse to add an interface by returning a
 *	negative error code (which will be seen in userspace.)
 *	Must be implemented.
 *
 * @remove_interface: Notifies a driver that an interface is going down.
 *	The @stop callback is called after this if it is the last interface
 *	and no monitor interfaces are present.
 *	When all interfaces are removed, the MAC address in the hardware
 *	must be cleared so the device no longer acknowledges packets,
 *	the mac_addr member of the conf structure is, however, set to the
 *	MAC address of the device going away.
 *	Hence, this callback must be implemented.
 *
 * @config: Handler for configuration requests. IEEE 802.11 code calls this
 *	function to change hardware configuration, e.g., channel.
 *
 * @config_interface: Handler for configuration requests related to interfaces
 *	(e.g. BSSID changes.)
 *
 * @bss_info_changed: Handler for configuration requests related to BSS
 *	parameters that may vary during BSS's lifespan, and may affect low
 *	level driver (e.g. assoc/disassoc status, erp parameters).
 *	This function should not be used if no BSS has been set, unless
 *	for association indication. The @changed parameter indicates which
 *	of the bss parameters has changed when a call is made.
 *
 * @configure_filter: Configure the device's RX filter.
 *	See the section "Frame filtering" for more information.
 *	This callback must be implemented and atomic.
 *
 * @set_tim: Set TIM bit. If the hardware/firmware takes care of beacon
 *	generation (that is, %IEEE80211_HW_HOST_GEN_BEACON_TEMPLATE is set)
 *	mac80211 calls this function when a TIM bit must be set or cleared
 *	for a given AID. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @set_key: See the section "Hardware crypto acceleration"
 *	This callback can sleep, and is only called between add_interface
 *	and remove_interface calls, i.e. while the interface with the
 *	given local_address is enabled.
 *
 * @update_tkip_key: See the section "Hardware crypto acceleration"
 * 	This callback will be called in the context of Rx. Called for drivers
 * 	which set IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_TKIP_REQ_RX_P1_KEY.
 *
 * @hw_scan: Ask the hardware to service the scan request, no need to start
 *	the scan state machine in stack. The scan must honour the channel
 *	configuration done by the regulatory agent in the wiphy's registered
 *	bands.
 *
 * @get_stats: return low-level statistics
 *
 * @get_tkip_seq: If your device implements TKIP encryption in hardware this
 *	callback should be provided to read the TKIP transmit IVs (both IV32
 *	and IV16) for the given key from hardware.
 *
 * @set_rts_threshold: Configuration of RTS threshold (if device needs it)
 *
 * @set_frag_threshold: Configuration of fragmentation threshold. Assign this if
 *	the device does fragmentation by itself; if this method is assigned then
 *	the stack will not do fragmentation.
 *
 * @set_retry_limit: Configuration of retry limits (if device needs it)
 *
 * @sta_notify: Notifies low level driver about addition or removal
 *	of assocaited station or AP.
 *
 * @conf_tx: Configure TX queue parameters (EDCF (aifs, cw_min, cw_max),
 *	bursting) for a hardware TX queue. The @queue parameter uses the
 *	%IEEE80211_TX_QUEUE_* constants. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @get_tx_stats: Get statistics of the current TX queue status. This is used
 *	to get number of currently queued packets (queue length), maximum queue
 *	size (limit), and total number of packets sent using each TX queue
 *	(count). This information is used for WMM to find out which TX
 *	queues have room for more packets and by hostapd to provide
 *	statistics about the current queueing state to external programs.
 *
 * @get_tsf: Get the current TSF timer value from firmware/hardware. Currently,
 *	this is only used for IBSS mode debugging and, as such, is not a
 *	required function. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @reset_tsf: Reset the TSF timer and allow firmware/hardware to synchronize
 *	with other STAs in the IBSS. This is only used in IBSS mode. This
 *	function is optional if the firmware/hardware takes full care of
 *	TSF synchronization.
 *
 * @beacon_update: Setup beacon data for IBSS beacons. Unlike access point,
 *	IBSS uses a fixed beacon frame which is configured using this
 *	function.
 *	If the driver returns success (0) from this callback, it owns
 *	the skb. That means the driver is responsible to kfree_skb() it.
 *	The control structure is not dynamically allocated. That means the
 *	driver does not own the pointer and if it needs it somewhere
 *	outside of the context of this function, it must copy it
 *	somewhere else.
 *	This handler is required only for IBSS mode.
 *
 * @tx_last_beacon: Determine whether the last IBSS beacon was sent by us.
 *	This is needed only for IBSS mode and the result of this function is
 *	used to determine whether to reply to Probe Requests.
 *
 * @conf_ht: Configures low level driver with 802.11n HT data. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @ampdu_action: Perform a certain A-MPDU action
 * 	The RA/TID combination determines the destination and TID we want
 * 	the ampdu action to be performed for. The action is defined through
 * 	ieee80211_ampdu_mlme_action. Starting sequence number (@ssn)
 * 	is the first frame we expect to perform the action on. notice
 * 	that TX/RX_STOP can pass NULL for this parameter.
