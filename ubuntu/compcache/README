ramzswap: Compressed RAM based swap device
-------------------------------------------

Project home: http://compcache.googlecode.com

* Introduction
This is a RAM based block device which acts as swap disk.
Pages swapped to this device are compressed and stored in
memory itself. See project home for use cases, performance
numbers and lot more.

* Compiling
 - Run 'make': this will compile all modules against your kernel.

 - Following kernel modules are created:
   - xvmalloc.ko
   - ramzswap.ko

* Using
 - Following scipts are included
   - use_ramzswap.sh [<disksize(KB)|<memlimit(KB)>] [<backing_swap>]
     This loads all required modules and sets up swap device.
     NOTE: script contains detailed documentation on parameters.

   - unuse_ramzswap.sh
     Unloads all modules and turns off ramzswap swap device.

* Common Problems
 - If you get lots of compile errors, make sure you have package for
   kernel source installed. For e.g., on Fedora its 'kernel-devel' package.

 - If (un)use_ramzswap scripts fail to work, refer to wiki:
   http://code.google.com/p/compcache/wiki/CompilingAndUsing

* Notes
 - Statistics are exported via /proc/ramzswap
