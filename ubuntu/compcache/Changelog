version 0.5.3	(8/4/2009)
 - Major cleanups.
 - Rename module: compcache.ko -> ramzswap.ko
 - Rename params: backing_dev -> backing_swap
 - Updated use_compcache.sh script with detailed
   documentation on parameters.
 - LZO de/compress modules are no longer packaged
   with compcache. Most distros now include these.

version 0.5.2	(11/3/2009)
 - Can forward incompressible pages to physical swap disk.
 - New module params:
 	- memlimit_kb
	- disksize_kb
	- backing_dev
   See use_compcache.sh for documentation on these params.
 - Modified use_compcache.sh script to handle new params.
 - Detect zero-filled pages and don't allocate any memory
   for them.

version 0.5.1	(22/1/2009)
 - Fix crash on x86 systems with higmem (mem > ~1G).
   This required minor changes to atomic (un)map functions (see Issue #20).

version 0.5	(16/1/2009)
 - Fix crash in case compcache init fails.

version 0.5pre4	(10/1/2009)
 - Support discarding pages for freed swap blocks (requires 2.6.28-git14).
   This feature will be disabled if compiled for older kernel.
 - Mark ramzswap as "solid-state" block device (requires 2.6.26-git14).
 - Fixed incorrect stats reporting in /proc/compcache (some
   new stats added too).

version 0.5pre3	(5/1/2009)
 - Use kmap_atomic() in xvMalloc. This fixes issue #19
 - Remove xvMapPage() and xvUnmapMap() from xvMalloc.

version 0.5pre2 (28/10/2008)
 - Alloc full page for uncompressible pages instead
   of returning I/O error.
 - Warn users when using ramzswap > (2 x RAM size)

version 0.5pre1 (15/10/2008)
 - Replaced TLSF with xvMalloc memory allocator
   http://code.google.com/p/compcache/wiki/xvMalloc

version 0.4	(13/8/2008)
 - Enable debug and stats option for compcache and tlsf by default
   proc nodes: /proc/{tlsfinfo,compcache}
 - Fix crash when reading /proc/tlsfinfo
 - Lots of cleanups: clean compile on x64
 
version 0.3	(17/3/2008)
 - Fix spurious swap read failures
 - Better swap request filtering
 - Swap device again renamed to /dev/ramzswap0
   This is to prevent Ubuntu installer from presenting
   this device as possible installation target (see Issue #5)
 - use_compcache.sh script now waits for disk node to be created
   instead of arbitrary sleep (see Issue #6).
 - Modified scripts: use_compcache.sh and unuse_compcache.sh
   to now use new device name (compcache0 -> ramzswap0).

version 0.2	(3/3/2008)
 - Fixed bug on systems with highmem
 - Better filtering-out of non-swap requests
 - Export statistics through proc nodes:
   - /proc/compcache
   - /proc/tlsfinfo
 - Debug and Statistics support for allocator
   and compcache can now be individually turned
   on/off by setting DEBUG, STATS to 0/1 in
   respective header files
 - Swap device now renamed to /dev/compcache0
 - Added scripts: use_compcache.sh and unuse_compcache.sh
   See README for usage
 - Default compcache size set to 25% of RAM
 - Lots of code cleanups
 - Updated README
 - Created Changelog :)
