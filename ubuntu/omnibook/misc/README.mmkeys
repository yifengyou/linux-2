This patch maps some extra Fn+key combinations to keycodes for multimedia
keyboards and only works for the nbsmi-backend. It might be useful if you
want to control some mediaplayer while working with other applications.

Following combinations are mapped:
Fn+Y => Previous song
Fn+X => Play/pause
Fn+V => Stop CD
Fn+B => Next song
