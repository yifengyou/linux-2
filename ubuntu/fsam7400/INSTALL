COMPILER REQUIREMENTS
---------   ------     ----       ---    --       --       -          -

You need to be using GCC v3.0 or higher in order to build the fsam7400 module.
Using older versions will result in several compilation errors.


INSTALLING THE BITS
------------ -----   -----       ----       ---       --         -

# Unpack the source tarball

% tar xvzf fsam7400-0.x.y.tgz
% cd fsam7400-0.x.y

Make sure to be root when performing the following operations. Also you must 
have a kernel source tree installed under /usr/src/linux

# Build the kernel module

% make 

Debug output is enabled by default. This is a good idea if you use the fsam module for 
the first time, so you get some nice information printed on kernel log. If you don't 
need the messages anymore, you have to comment out the line CONFIG_IPW2100_DEBUG=y in 
the Makefile.

# Install the kernel module

% make install

Now you are ready for...


LOADING THE DRIVER
------------ -----   -----       ----       ---       --         -

Also easy to go... :)

% modprobe fsam7400

If you have set "wireless device" enabled in your "Advanced" bios settings of
your Amilo M 7400 radio should be turned on at this point. So you're done!
Watch out your kernel log if supported hardware was found. :)


RADIO STATE AT LOADING

You can override the wireless bios setting with

% modprobe fsam7400 radio=[0|1]


PROC FILESYSTEM

If your hardware is supported by the driver you will get an entry in /proc 
called driver/wireless/radio which will give you state information by typing

% cat /proc/driver/wireless/radio

You can turn the radio on and off at your will with 

% echo [1|on] > /proc/driver/wireless/radio
% echo [0|off] > /proc/driver/wireless/radio

The module also recognizes parameters to set the user- and/or group-ID to 
something other than root, so you don't have to adjust it by hand. 
Just select your favourite IDs and type

% modprobe fsam7400 uid=1000 gid=500

Note, that /proc/driver/wireless/radio will only be read- and writeable by 
user & group and only readable by others.

If you want to see debug output on syslog use the following parameter when 
loading the module 

% modprobe fsam7400 debug=1


AUTOMATION FEATURES

By default the driver will turn off the radio automatically short before the 
module is unloaded. To override this behaviour load the module adding the 
following parameter

% modprobe fsam7400 autooff=0

Also since 0.4.0 the driver can automatically modprobe the ipw2100 module when
radio state changes to on and rmmods it when radio is turned off by fsam7400.
To enable autoload support, use

% modprobe fsam7400 autoload=1


HIBERNATION SUPPORT

After hibernation and boot up of the system the wireless radio might be disabled
again. To revert to the radio state before hibernation just put the following
in the wakeup script

% echo resume > /proc/driver/wireless/radio



That's all for now. Have fun with the driver!
